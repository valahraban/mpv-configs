# mpv-configs
The configs for mpv that I use. On Windows, these files are to be dropped inside of AppData\Roaming\mpv or wherever you have mpv installed. Linux users should know where their mpv configs go. The optional MIT licensed shaders can be obtained here and are extremely recommended for cartoon and anime fans. https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K/releases/
