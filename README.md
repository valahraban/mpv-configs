# mpv-configs
The configs that I use for mpv. On Windows, these files are to be dropped inside of AppData\Roaming\mpv or wherever you have mpv installed. Linux users should know where their mpv configs go. Shaders go inside AppData\Roaming\mpv\shaders. The optional MIT licensed shaders can be obtained here and are extremely recommended for cartoon and anime fans. https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K/releases/

Another useful repository for external shaders. https://github.com/iwalton3/default-shader-pack

FSRCNN here. https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases

Classicjazz small shader collection and nice config. https://github.com/classicjazz/mpv-config

If you don't like how mpv handles setting tracks by default (I don't) grab and configure this. https://github.com/po5/trackselect
